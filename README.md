# cs50-resize
This program resizes (i.e., enlarges) 24-bit uncompressed BMPs by a factor of 'n'. It accepts three command-line arguments, where the first is the factor 'n', the second is the name of the BMP to be resized, and the third is the name of the resized version to be written.

Assigned as PSET 4 during Harvard's fall 2018 CS50 course.
